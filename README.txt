1. How to compile?

The code is wrriten in Jupyter notebook and it requires sklearn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries.
And it's better that we use Pyhton version: Python 3.7.4, Anaconda(I guess Python 3.X will be sufficient).

2. How to run?
Just run 4 code files respectively. They correspond to different questions in Assignment 2.

*Note: In order to read from CSV files, we need to place a directory named "Assignment2" in the same level as 
the source file and include all CSV files under it.
